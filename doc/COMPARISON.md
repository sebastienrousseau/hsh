# Ecosystem comparison

How `hsh` compares to the major Rust password-hashing crates. The
goal of this document is to help you decide whether `hsh` is the
right pick for your use case — and if not, where to look instead.

## When to pick which

### Pick `hsh` if

- You want **multi-algorithm support** with one API.
- You need **auto-rehash on policy drift** (algorithm or parameter migration).
- You're running a **passkey-primary architecture** and need the password-fallback / recovery-credential side to be hardened against offline replay (see [`PASSKEY-ERA.md`](PASSKEY-ERA.md) for the three reference recipes).
- You want **in-process versioned pepper** today; KMS-backed providers (AWS / GCP / Azure / Vault) are stub interfaces in v0.0.9 and land for real in 0.1.x.
- You're going to deploy in a regulated environment where the **FIPS 140-3 *contract*** matters (mint-time fail-closed behaviour). The **validated runtime** (PBKDF2 through `aws-lc-rs`) lands as `hsh-backend-awslc` in 0.1.x.
- You want a **CLI** for ops / scripting.
- You value enterprise-grade **supply-chain hygiene** (SLSA L3, sigstore, SBOM, Scorecard).

### Pick `argonautica` if

- Don't. It's been unmaintained since March 2019. No security
  updates. FFI binding to a C library that has its own
  vulnerabilities timeline.

### Pick `rust-argon2` if

- You only need Argon2, you don't need multi-algorithm migration,
  and you want the smallest possible dependency surface.
- Future-proofing against algorithm rotation isn't important.

### Pick `bcrypt` directly if

- You're integrating with an existing bcrypt-only codebase and don't
  need any of `hsh`'s safety / migration features.
- **Be aware** of the 72-byte truncation behaviour (CVE-2025-22228
  class). If your application might receive long inputs, use `hsh`'s
  `BcryptParams::with_prehash` adapter or hand-roll the same.

### Pick `password-auth` if

- You're already on the RustCrypto stack and want a thin facade.
- You don't need pepper / FIPS / CLI / packaging.

### Pick `djangohashers` if

- You're consuming hashes produced by a Python/Django sibling
  service and need format compatibility.
- For new code that owns its own hashes, prefer `hsh` and use
  [`doc/MIGRATION-from-djangohashers.md`](MIGRATION-from-djangohashers.md)
  to wrap.

## Migration guides

For each crate above, `hsh` ships a step-by-step migration:

- [Migrating from `argonautica`](MIGRATION-from-argonautica.md)
- [Migrating from `rust-argon2`](MIGRATION-from-rust-argon2.md)
- [Migrating from `bcrypt`](MIGRATION-from-bcrypt.md)
- [Migrating from `djangohashers`](MIGRATION-from-djangohashers.md)
- [Migrating from `password-hash` (RustCrypto stack)](MIGRATION-from-password-hash.md)

Each guide includes the equivalent `hsh` API calls, a Cargo.toml
diff, and a breaking-change checklist.

## Methodology

This matrix was compiled by reading each crate's latest published
release on crates.io, its README, and its `docs.rs` API surface.
Versions surveyed as of 2026-05-19:

- `argonautica` 0.2.0 (last release 2019-03-05)
- `rust-argon2` 3.0.0 (2025-07-17)
- `bcrypt` 0.19.1 (2026-05-06)
- `password-auth` 1.1.0-rc.1 (2026-01-12)
- `scrypt` 0.12.0 (2026-04-22)
- `djangohashers` 1.8.4 (2025-12-28)

Re-check upstream versions and re-render this matrix periodically
(at minimum at every release; ideally as part of the annual
standards review in [`IP-GOVERNANCE.md`](IP-GOVERNANCE.md)).
