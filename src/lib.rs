//!
//! A Highly Secure Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Hash Library for Password Encryption and Verification in Rust. Designed with quantum-resistant cryptography, this library provides a robust line of defence against current and emerging computational threats.

//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Hash (HSH) Rust library provides an interface for implementing secure hash and digest algorithms, specifically designed for password encryption and verification.
//!
//! The library provides a simple API that makes it easy to store and verify hashed passwords. It enables robust security for passwords, using the latest advancements in Quantum-resistant cryptography. Quantum- resistant cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms, usually public-key algorithms, that are thought to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. As quantum computing continues to advance, this feature of the library assures that the passwords managed through this system remain secure even against cutting-edge computational capabilities.
//!
//! The library supports the following Password Hashing Schemes (Password Based Key Derivation Functions):
//!
//! - **Argon2i**: A cutting-edge and highly secure key derivation function designed to protect against both traditional brute-force attacks and rainbow table attacks. (Recommended)
//! - **Bcrypt**: A password hashing function designed to be secure against brute-force attacks. It is a work-factor function, which means that it takes a certain amount of time to compute. This makes it difficult to attack with a brute-force algorithm.
//! - **Scrypt**: A password hashing function designed to be secure against both brute-force attacks and rainbow table attacks. It is a memory-hard and work- factor function, which means that it requires a lot of memory and time to compute. This makes it very difficult to attack with a GPU or other parallel computing device.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Ease of Use**: Simple API for storing and verifying hashed passwords.
//! - **Future-Proof**: Quantum-resistant cryptography to secure against future technological advancements.
//! - **Integrable**: Written in Rust, the library is fast, efficient, and easily integrable into other Rust projects.
//! - **Versatility**: Supports multiple Password Hashing Schemes like Argon2i, Bcrypt, and Scrypt.
//!
//! ## Core Components
//!
//! ### `Hash` Struct
//!
//! Contains:
//!
//! - **algorithm**: Enum representing the hashing algorithm (Argon2i, Bcrypt, Scrypt).
//! - **hash**: Byte vector containing the hashed password.
//! - **salt**: Byte vector containing the salt used in hashing.
//!
//! ### `HashAlgorithm` Enum
//!
//! Provides variants for supported hashing algorithms: Argon2i, Bcrypt, and Scrypt.
//!
//! ## Methods
//!
//! The `Hash` struct offers methods for password hashing and management, including but not limited to:
//!
//! - Creating new Hash objects.
//! - Generating and setting salts and hashes.
//! - Verifying passwords against stored hashes.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! Add `Hash (HSH)` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` and import it in your main Rust file.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! Here's a simple example demonstrating basic usage:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use hsh::models::hash::Hash;  // Import the Hash struct
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let password = "password123";
//!     let salt = "somesalt";
//!     let algo = "argon2i";
//!
//!     let original_hash = Hash::new(password, salt, algo).expect("Failed to create hash");
//!     let hashed_password = original_hash.hash.clone();
//!
//!     assert_eq!(original_hash.hash(), &hashed_password);
//! }
//! ```
