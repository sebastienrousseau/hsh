## Overview ðŸ“–

The `Hash (HSH)` Rust library provides an interface for implementing secure hash and digest algorithms, specifically designed for password encryption and verification.

The library provides a simple API that makes it easy to store and verify hashed passwords. It enables robust security for passwords, using the latest advancements in **Quantum-resistant cryptography**. Quantum-resistant cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms, that are thought to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. As quantum computing continues to advance, this feature of the library assures that the passwords managed through this system remain secure even against cutting-edge computational capabilities.

The library supports the following Password Hashing Schemes (Password Based Key Derivation Functions):

- [**Argon2i**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2>): A cutting-edge and highly secure key derivation function designed to protect against both traditional brute-force attacks and rainbow table attacks. (Recommended)
- [**Bcrypt**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt>): A password hashing function designed to be secure against brute-force attacks. It is a work-factor function, which means that it takes a certain amount of time to compute. This makes it difficult to attack with a brute-force algorithm.
- [**Scrypt**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt>): A password hashing function designed to be secure against both brute-force attacks and rainbow table attacks. It is a memory-hard and work-factor function, which means that it requires a lot of memory and time to compute. This makes it very difficult to attack with a GPU or other parallel computing device.

The library is a valuable tool for developers who need to store and verify passwords in a secure manner. It is easy to use and can be integrated into a variety of applications.

## Features âœ¨

- **Compliant with multiple Password Hashing Schemes (Password Based Key Derivation Functions) such as Argon2i, Bcrypt and Scrypt.** This makes the library more versatile and can be used in a variety of applications.
- **Quantum-resistant, making it secure against future attacks using quantum computers.** This is an important feature as quantum computers become more powerful.
- **Easy to use.** The library provides a simple API that makes it easy to store and verify hashed passwords.
- **Can be integrated into a variety of applications.** The library is written in Rust, which makes it easy to integrate into any Rust project and is fast, efficient, and secure.

### Secure password storage

Hash (HSH) provides a secure way to store and verify hashed passwords. Passwords are hashed using the argon2i, bcrypt, scrypt algorithms, which are considered one of the most secure hashing algorithms available today. The library provides a simple interface for generating and verifying hashes, making it easy to implement secure password storage in any Rust application.

### Easy to use

Hash (HSH) includes simple functions for generating and verifying password hashes, and managing password and salt values. Developers can easily integrate the library into their Rust projects and start using it right away. The library is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, so developers can build apps without worrying about password security.

### Flexible

Hash (HSH) allows users to customize the length of passwords and salts used in generating hashes. This flexibility allows developers to tailor the library to their specific needs, whether they require shorter or longer password and salt values. The library also includes macros that make it easy to work with the Hash structure, allowing developers to quickly and easily set and retrieve password and salt values.

### Lightweight

Hash (HSH) is a lightweight library that can easily integrate into any Rust project. The library has no external dependencies and is efficient. It means that developers can add secure password storage to their applications without having to worry about significant performance overheads.
