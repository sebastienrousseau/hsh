## Overview üìñ

The Hash (HSH) library is a cryptographic hash library for password hashing and verification in Rust, based on the `argon2rs` crate.

This library is designed to provide robust security for passwords, utilizing the latest advancements in quantum-resistant cryptography.

It is based on the `argon2rs` crate. The library implements a struct named `Hash` that provides various methods for password hash generation, retrieval, and verification.

## Features ‚ú®

### Hash Struct

The `Hash` struct has three fields:

- `password`: A string that stores the plaintext password.
- `hash`: A vector of bytes that stores the hashed password.
- `salt`: A vector of bytes that stores the salt used for password
  hashing.

### Hash Methods

The `Hash` structure provides the following methods for password hashing
and verification:

- `generate_hash`: A static method that generates a hash from a plaintext password and salt.
- `hash`: A method that returns the hash as a slice of bytes.
- `salt`: A method that returns the salt as a slice of bytes.
- `hash_length`: A method that returns the length of the hash.
- `new`: A constructor method that creates a new `Hash` struct instance with the given plaintext password and salt.
- `password`: A method that returns the password as a string.
- `password_length`: A method that returns the length of the password.
- `set_password`: A method that sets a new password and generates a new hash.
- `set_hash`: A method that sets a new hash.
- `set_salt`: A method that sets a new salt.
- `from_hash`: A method that creates a `Hash` struct instance from a given hash.
- `verify`: A method that verifies a plaintext password against the stored hash.
- `to_string_representation`: A method that returns the hash as a string.

### Traits

The `Hash` struct also implements the following traits:

- `FromStr`: Allows the `Hash` struct to be converted from a string.
- `std::fmt::Display`: Allows the `Hash` struct to be printed as a string.

### Macros

The library also provides several macros for common operations on the `Hash` struct:

- `password_length`: Returns the length of the password for a given `Hash` struct instance.
- `set_hash`: Sets a new hash value for a given `Hash` struct instance.
- `set_password`: Sets a new password and salt value for a given `Hash` struct instance.
- `set_salt`: Sets a new salt value for a given `Hash` struct instance.
- `generate_hash`: Generates a new hash for a given password and salt.
- `verify_password`: Verifies if the password matches the hash of a given `Hash` struct instance.
- `new_hash`: Creates a new instance of the `Hash` struct with the given password and salt.
- `display_hash`: Prints the hash of a given `Hash` struct instance to the console.
- `to_string`: Converts a given `Hash` struct instance to a string.

### Security and Performance

It is important to note that the library uses the `argon2rs` crate for password hashing, which is a secure and quantum-resistant password hashing library.

## Installation üì¶

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `hsh`.

### Requirements

`hsh` requires Rust **1.67.0** or later.

### Documentation

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info:** Please check out our [website][0] for more information and find our documentation on [docs.rs][9], [lib.rs][10] and [crates.io][8].

## Usage üìñ

To use `hsh` in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
hsh = "0.0.2"
```

Add the following to your `main.rs` file:

```rust
extern crate hsh;
use hsh::*;
```

then you can use the functions in your application code.

### Examples

`HRC` comes with a set of examples that you can use to get started. The examples are located in the `examples` directory of the project. To run the examples, clone the repository and run the following command in your terminal from the project root directory.

```shell
cargo run --example hsh
```
