## Overview üìñ

The `Hash (HSH)` Rust library provides an interface for implementing
secure hash and digest algorithms, specifically designed for password
encryption and verification.

The library provides a simple API that makes it easy to store and verify
hashed passwords. It enables robust security for passwords, using the
latest advancements in `Quantum-resistant cryptography`. Quantum-
resistant cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms, usually
public-key algorithms, that are thought to be secure against an attack
by a quantum computer. As quantum computing continues to advance, this
feature of the library assures that the passwords managed through this
system remain secure even against cutting-edge computational
capabilities.

The library supports the following Password Hashing Schemes (Password
Based Key Derivation Functions):

- [**Argon2i**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2>): A cutting-edge
  and highly secure key derivation function designed to protect against
  both traditional brute-force attacks and rainbow table attacks.
  (Recommended)
- [**Bcrypt**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt>): A password
  hashing function designed to be secure against brute-force attacks.
  It is a work-factor function, which means that it takes a certain
  amount of time to compute. This makes it difficult to attack with a
  brute-force algorithm.
- [**Scrypt**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt>): A password
  hashing function designed to be secure against both brute-force
  attacks and rainbow table attacks. It is a memory-hard and work-
  factor function, which means that it requires a lot of memory and
  time to compute. This makes it very difficult to attack with a GPU
  or other parallel computing device.

The library is a valuable tool for developers who need to store and
verify passwords in a secure manner. It is easy to use and can be
integrated into a variety of applications.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Compliant with multiple Password Hashing Schemes (Password Based Key Derivation Functions) such as Argon2i, Bcrypt and Scrypt.** This makes the library more versatile and can be used in a variety of applications.
- **Quantum-resistant, making it secure against future attacks using quantum computers.** This is an important feature as quantum computers become more powerful.
- **Easy to use.** The library provides a simple API that makes it easy to store and verify hashed passwords.
- **Can be integrated into a variety of applications.** The library is written in Rust, which makes it easy to integrate into any Rust project and is fast, efficient, and secure.

### Secure password storage

Hash (HSH) provides a secure way to store and verify hashed passwords.
Passwords are hashed using the argon2i, bcrypt, scrypt algorithms, which
are considered one of the most secure hashing algorithms available
today. The library provides a simple interface for generating and
verifying hashes, making it easy to implement secure password storage
in any Rust application.

### Easy to use

Hash (HSH) includes simple functions for generating and verifying
password hashes, and managing password and salt values. Developers can
easily integrate the library into their Rust projects and start using
it right away. The library is designed to be intuitive and easy to use,
so developers can build apps without worrying about password security.

### Flexible

Hash (HSH) allows users to customize the length of passwords and salts
used in generating hashes. This flexibility allows developers to tailor
the library to their specific needs, whether they require shorter or
longer password and salt values. The library also includes macros that
make it easy to work with the Hash structure, allowing developers to
quickly and easily set and retrieve password and salt values.

### Lightweight

Hash (HSH) is a lightweight library that can easily integrate into any
Rust project. The library has no external dependencies and is efficient.
It means that developers can add secure password storage to their
applications without having to worry about significant performance
overheads.

## Installation üì¶

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `hsh`.

### Requirements

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently Rust
**1.69.0** or later (stable). It is recommended that you install the
latest stable version of Rust.
